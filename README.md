Simple Weather app for Android

The app is currently under development and is almost guaranteed to be unstable and buggy.  We are working towards a launch in the fall.  In the meantime, it is being alpha tested through Google Play, and is heavily under development.

We are also currently in the process of switching the whole app from Java to Kotlin, which I am about halfway finished with.  That should be done shortly.

Please feel free to submit any bugs through Github Issues, as long as they don't already exist and you submit a thorough report of what happened.

Thanks for checking out the app!
